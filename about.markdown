## 3D Artist // Project Director

I run the VR Rave group <a href="https://reyov.net">REYOV</a> on VRCHAT as Director and Environmental Art
Im also a part of a team SNR Labs where our work has been shown at the <a href="https://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/2024/venice-immersive/snr-labs-test-facility">Venice Film Festival </a>with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32997352/fullcredits/"> 
[IMDB Credit] </a>

The project has taught me how to manage a team and develop a project in a AGILE workflow and git/gluon setup using UnityVCS to manage the Unity Project

Recently I have also spent time learning TouchDesigner to better understand shader workflows for Generative Visual Art
Its been a great opening into understand how Shaders are generally programmed and backed up my previous knowledge of learning GLSL
