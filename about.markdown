## 3D Artist // Project Director

I run the VR Rave group [REYOV]("https://reyov.net") on VRCHAT as Director and Environmental Art
Im also a part of a team SNR Labs where our work has been shown at the [Venice Film Festival](https://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/2024/venice-immersive/snr-labs-test-facility") with 
[IMDB Credit]("https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32997352/fullcredits/")

The project has taught me how to manage a team and develop a project in a AGILE workflow and git/gluon setup using UnityVCS to manage the Unity Project
between other developers. I have also as a hobby developed my skill as a 3d artist during the pandemic and have helped to develop in small indie game projects

Recently I have also spent time learning TouchDesigner to better understand shader workflows for Generative Visual Art
