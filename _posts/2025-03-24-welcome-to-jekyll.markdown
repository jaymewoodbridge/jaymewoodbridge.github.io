While studying for the pentest plus I took it upon myself to write the templates from
Tryhackme and HTB learnings to make an overall CommonTools script to better learn
how to use my previous SW Engineer skills in Pythont to develop skills as a pentester

I made my first push here on <a href="https://github.com/jaymewoodbridge/PentestScripts"> GitHub </a>
And you can take a look at it now, there will be plans to make this launch as a modular application
to where I can choose the tool and the arguments from terminal via sys.args input.

Tools available include sub-domain enumeration, directory enumeration, portscanning, file downloading and more.
After creating a decent structure for terminal use I will most likely include more tools and methodology 
as I plan to use this for my future HTB Boxes and Bug Bounty Hunts
